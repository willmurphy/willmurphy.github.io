    <h2>Themes</h2>

    <div class="theme-item">
      <h3>The Authenticity Crisis</h3>
      <div class="signals">Social: AI content backlash, micro-community migration, #BringBack2016 · Technological: AI content surpasses human output</div>
      <p>Across domains, the same signal is repeating: people are retreating from scale. AI-generated content now outnumbers human writing online, and nearly a third of consumers are actively punishing brands that use it. The nostalgia for 2016 isn't random — it's a longing for an era before algorithmic feeds and synthetic media dominated daily life. Users migrating to Discord servers and private groups are making the same choice: smaller, slower, more real. The world may be entering a phase where authenticity becomes a scarce and premium resource.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="theme-item">
      <h3>The AI Infrastructure Arms Race</h3>
      <div class="signals">Technological: AI chip funding surge, MCP standardization, simultaneous model drops · Economic: AI as the decade's defining capex</div>
      <p>The competition to own AI's foundational layer is accelerating at a pace that has no recent parallel. Billions of dollars are flowing into custom inference chips, standardized protocols, and model infrastructure in a single month. The adoption of MCP as the universal connector standard signals that the industry is moving from experimentation to construction — laying permanent rails for an AI-native economy. The companies and countries that control this infrastructure layer will have structural advantages that compound for decades.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="theme-item">
      <h3>The Autonomy Threshold</h3>
      <div class="signals">Technological: Wayve AV funding, NASA Perseverance AI navigation, MCP enabling AI agents · Economic: Labor market at post-2002 lows</div>
      <p>Machines crossed several meaningful lines this month: a rover navigated Mars without human input, a car startup raised $1.2B to put robotaxis on city streets, and AI agents are projected to run 40% of enterprise workflows by year's end. Simultaneously, U.S. job creation hit its weakest non-recessionary pace since 2002. These trends are not yet proven to be causally linked, but they are converging. The question of which human tasks remain distinctly human — and which don't — is moving from philosophy to policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="theme-item">
      <h3>Institutional Fragility Under Strain</h3>
      <div class="signals">Economic: SCOTUS tariff ruling, Fed's impossible trilemma, trade policy whiplash · Social: Platform trust erosion</div>
      <p>Major institutions are being tested simultaneously. The Supreme Court invalidated a key presidential trade mechanism, forcing an immediate executive workaround. The Federal Reserve faces a policy trilemma with no clean exit — cutting rates feeds inflation, holding them deepens the labor slowdown. Social platforms are losing users to private channels as trust in their neutrality erodes. The common thread is that systems built for a different era are being stress-tested by conditions they weren't designed to handle, and the improvised responses are creating new uncertainties.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="theme-item">
      <h3>Cultural Power Is Shifting</h3>
      <div class="signals">Social: Bad Bunny's Spanish-only halftime, Grammy cultural moment, generational nostalgia splits · Economic: Global trade realignment, emerging market investment inflows</div>
      <p>Bad Bunny's entirely Spanish-language Super Bowl halftime is not just a cultural milestone — it's a data point in a longer story about whose culture defines the mainstream. At the same time, UNCTAD's trade data shows investment flowing into Vietnam, India, and Indonesia as supply chains diversify away from established hubs. Cultural and economic influence are both decentralizing, and the generational split in nostalgia — Gen Alpha embracing absurdism, Millennials looking backward — reflects a world where no single shared reference point dominates. Power is pluralizing.</p>

      <h3>OpenAI and Anthropic Drop Major Model Updates Simultaneously</h3>
      <p>On February 7, OpenAI released GPT-5.3-Codex with a new "Frontier" feature for managing AI workers at the enterprise level, while Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.6 with a one-million-token context window on the same day. The coordinated timing appears coincidental but signals how compressed the competitive release cycle has become. Chinese firm Zhipu's simultaneous GLM-5 launch — which hit number one on open-source benchmarks and caused a 30% price increase due to demand — underscores that the frontier model race is now genuinely global.</p>

      <h3>Model Context Protocol Becomes the Industry Standard for AI Integration</h3>
      <p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP), originally developed by Anthropic and donated to the Linux Foundation, is now being adopted by OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google as the default standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources. The protocol's broad acceptance is accelerating enterprise AI deployment by providing a common interface layer, reducing the custom integration work that has been a major friction point. Gartner now projects 40% of enterprise applications will embed AI agents by end of 2026, up from just 5% in 2025.</p>

      <h3>AI Chip Startups Attract Billions as Inference Demand Surges</h3>
      <p>A new wave of AI infrastructure investment is concentrating in custom silicon. This month, MatX secured $500 million in a Series B led by Jane Street; Taalas raised $169 million for AI inference chips; and SambaNova closed $350 million to meet demand for real-time AI hardware. The common thread is inference efficiency — as training costs plateau, the bottleneck has shifted to running models cheaply and quickly at scale, and custom chips purpose-built for inference are the proposed solution.</p>

      <p>UK-based autonomous vehicle startup Wayve raised $1.2 billion in a Series D led by Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, Nissan, and Uber, bringing its total funding to $2.8 billion. The round signals renewed institutional confidence in AV technology following a period of high-profile setbacks and consolidation. Wayve plans to deploy Uber robotaxis in multiple cities in 2026 using its software-defined approach, which trains on diverse real-world driving data rather than relying on expensive HD mapping infrastructure.</p>

      <h3>NASA's Perseverance Rover Drives Itself Across Mars Using AI</h3>
      <p>NASA's Perseverance rover made history this month by autonomously navigating routes across the Martian surface planned entirely by artificial intelligence, without human operators in the loop. The milestone marks a significant step in deep-space autonomy — with communication delays between Earth and Mars averaging 20 minutes each way, AI-driven navigation is not just a convenience but a practical necessity for future missions. The achievement is being cited as a model for AI deployment in environments where real-time human oversight is impossible.</p>

      <h3>Supreme Court Strikes Down IEEPA Tariffs; Trump Pivots to Section 122</h3>
      <p>In a 6-3 ruling on February 20, the Supreme Court struck down all tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, including the so-called "reciprocal" and "fentanyl" tariff regimes, ruling the mechanism unconstitutional. Within days, President Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10% tariff on all countries under Section 122 — a different legal authority — effective February 24. The Yale Budget Lab estimates the combined 2026 Trump tariff regime amounts to an average tax increase of $1,500 per U.S. household, the largest as a share of GDP since 1993.</p>

      <h3>Labor Market Posts Weakest Year Since 2002 Outside of Recession</h3>
      <p>2025 was the weakest year for U.S. job creation since 2002, excluding recessionary periods — just 181,000 new jobs for the full year, averaging roughly 15,000 per month. The unemployment rate climbed from 4.1% to 4.4%, signaling that labor demand weakened faster than supply. January's jobs report, delayed by a partial government shutdown and released in early February alongside the CPI, is being closely watched for whether the softness is a correction or the start of a sustained trend.</p>

      <h3>Tariff-Driven Inflation Complicates Fed's Path</h3>
      <p>Goldman Sachs projects that the current tariff regime will raise the consumer price level by 1% between H2 2025 and H1 2026, adding persistent upward pressure even as underlying core goods inflation has been cooling. The Federal Reserve faces an increasingly difficult balancing act: cutting rates to support a softening labor market risks amplifying tariff-driven price increases, while holding rates risks deepening the jobs slowdown. Fed Governor Waller signaled this month that the bar for cuts remains high absent clear disinflationary data.</p>

      <h3>AI Infrastructure Becomes the Decade's Defining Capital Expenditure</h3>
      <p>Venture funding into AI-native infrastructure — custom chips, inference platforms, robotics, and vertical SaaS — reached several billion dollars in February alone. Major rounds from MatX, Wayve, SambaNova, Taalas, and accounting AI platform Basis (which raised $100M from Accel and GV) reflect a maturing investment thesis: the AI application layer is becoming commoditized, and the real value accrues to infrastructure, data pipelines, and domain-specific deployment. Watch for consolidation among AI platform companies as the year progresses.</p>

      <h3>Global Trade Realignment: Who Wins When U.S. Tariffs Shift?</h3>
      <p>A February 2026 UNCTAD report finds that U.S. tariff turbulence is producing a clear set of beneficiaries: the UK, EU, and Japan all register small long-run gains as trade flows reroute through lower-tariff corridors. Canada sees the steepest relative decline with IEEPA tariffs now struck down, while China and Mexico absorb meaningful economic contractions from remaining tariff exposure. Emerging markets with manufacturing capacity — Vietnam, India, Indonesia — continue to see investment inflows as supply chain diversification accelerates.</p>

      <p>A wave of nostalgia for the mid-2010s is sweeping TikTok and X, anchored by the hashtags #BringBack2016 and #2026isthenew2016. The trend is fueled by the resurgence of songs like "Lean On" and "Lush Life," with creators framing 2016 as "the last year of digital innocence" before algorithmic feeds and AI-generated content became dominant. Watch for brands to lean into throwback aesthetics and early-social-media aesthetics as this sentiment grows.</p>

      <p>Discord servers, niche subreddits, and private WhatsApp groups are seeing notable growth as users grow fatigued by the noise of algorithmic main feeds. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok are responding with close-friends and broadcast-channel features, but the structural shift toward intentional, smaller audiences reflects broader platform trust erosion. Brands investing in community-led growth are outperforming those relying purely on paid reach.</p>

      <p>AI-generated articles surpassed human-written content online for the first time in 2025, and the blowback is now measurable: nearly a third of consumers say they are less likely to buy from brands that use AI-generated advertising. Authenticity signals — lo-fi video, unedited creator content, founder-led storytelling — are commanding premium engagement rates as a direct reaction. The tension between AI efficiency and perceived authenticity is becoming a central brand strategy question heading into Q2.</p>
